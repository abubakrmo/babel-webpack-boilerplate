<h1>Babel and Webpack Boilerplate</h1>
This project serves as a template for integrating Babel and Webpack within your project.
<h1>Babel</h1>
Babel is a free and open-source JavaScript transcompiler that is mainly used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into backwards-compatible JavaScript code that can be run by older JavaScript engines.
<h1>Webpack</h1>
Webpack is a free and open-source module bundler for JavaScript. It is made primarily for JavaScript, but it can transform front-end assets such as HTML, CSS, and images if the corresponding loaders are included. Webpack takes modules with dependencies and generates static assets representing those modules.

<h1>Using the boilerplate</h1>
Clone the boilerplate in any file directory your project is, run "npm i" to install all dependencies.
<ul>
  <li>
    Once this is complete you can choose to run your project either by running this command "npm run build" and open with a live server or whichever method you deem suitable.  
    <b>(for production)</b>  
  </li>
  <li>
    Another way to run your project on a server is by running this command "npm run serve" which serves a webpack app. <b>(for development only)</b>
  </li>
</ul>
